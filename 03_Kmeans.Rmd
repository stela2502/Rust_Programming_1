# Use the Data class to implement a kmeans algorithm

Honestly - nowadays I never start anything without asking ChatGPT.
So why not use it here, too.

Hi Chatgpt. Can you tell me how to code kmeans in Rust if the data is stored in 2d ndarrays  and the rows should be clustered.

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an implementation of the KMeans algorithm in Rust using the ndarray crate to handle the 2D data:

rust

use ndarray::{Array2, Axis};

fn kmeans(data: &Array2<f64>, k: usize) -> Array2<f64> {
    let n = data.nrows();
    let d = data.ncols();
    let mut centroids = data.slice(s![..k, ..]).to_owned();
    let mut labels = Array2::zeros((n, 1));

    loop {
        let mut new_labels = Array2::zeros((n, 1));
        for i in 0..n {
            let mut min_distance = f64::INFINITY;
            for j in 0..k {
                let distance = (data.slice(s![i, ..]) - centroids.slice(s![j, ..])).norm();
                if distance < min_distance {
                    min_distance = distance;
                    new_labels[[i, 0]] = j as f64;
                }
            }
        }
        if new_labels == labels {
            break;
        }
        labels.assign(&new_labels);
        for j in 0..k {
            let mask = labels.iter().enumerate().filter(|(_, &l)| l == j as f64)
                .map(|(i, _)| i).collect::<Vec<_>>();
            let cluster_data = data.select(Axis(0), &mask);
            if !cluster_data.is_empty() {
                centroids.slice_mut(s![j, ..]).assign(&cluster_data.mean_axis(Axis(0)).unwrap());
            }
        }
    }
    labels
}

This implementation takes as input an Array2<f64> representing the data, and an integer k representing the number of clusters to find. It returns an Array2<f64> of the same shape as the input data, containing the cluster labels for each row.

The algorithm works as follows:

    Initialize centroids to k randomly chosen rows from the input data.
    Loop until convergence:
    a. Assign each row to the cluster with the closest centroid.
    b. Update the centroid of each cluster to be the mean of its assigned rows.
    c. If the cluster assignments haven't changed, exit the loop.
    Return the cluster labels for each row.

The implementation should be fairly self-explanatory, but I'll provide some additional details:

    We use the norm() method to compute the Euclidean distance between a row of data and a centroid.
    The slice() method is used to extract subsets of the data and centroids arrays.
    The select() method is used to extract the rows of data belonging to a given cluster.
    The mean_axis() method is used to compute the mean of the rows belonging to a given cluster.

Hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Sure - why not. But the Data obejct does not use an Array2. How to fix that? I am interested in your results :-D
