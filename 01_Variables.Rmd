# Variables

Rust uses strong typed variables. This does mean that you need to define your variables as a specific type.
As an example you can store integer values as u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, usize or integer.
All of these types can not be compared against each other. So if you want to create some data structures it does help to choose the same type for all data (eg. u64). 
The difference between the integer types are the range of values they can contain: u8 and i8 are 8 bit long whereas u128 and i128 are 128 bit long; the u types are unsigned and can not contain negative values. 
Usize is the default integer type and is dependent on your computer type. On 64 bit computers it is the same as a u64 - but you still can not compare it directly to u64.

# Examples

Writing this tutorial in RStudio I want to show you the pure basics of Rust:

- define a variable
- do a small calculation

I used this here simply to show you how variables are defined and how to break this simple logics.

### Integers

Using RStudio at the moment I can show you how you define a variable in Rust:

```{extendr, eval=eval_rextender}
let x = 5;
let y = 7;
let z = x*y;

rprintln!("{x} * {y} = {z}");
```

The print statement here is not Rust but specific for the R extension rextendr.
The Rust equivalent to the rptintln!() is println!().
The interesting part here is how you define variables: "let \<varname\>:\<type\> = \<value\>;"

Why did we not define the type of integer we want to store?

This is a case where Rust silently assumes you want to use the default integer type usize.
If you want to specify the integer type you want to use here you could write the following:

```{extendr, eval=eval_rextender}
let x:u8 = 5;
let y:u8 = 7;
let z = x*y;

rprintln!("{x} * {y} = {z}");
```

### Strings

So what about strings?

```{extendr, eval=eval_rextender}
let seq = "AGCT";
let bseq = b"AGCT";

rprintln!("{seq}");
rprintln!("{bseq:?}");
```

Strings are (internally) stored as char arrays (&[u8]), but the println! macro already formates a \<String\> object to be human readable. The b"\<String\>" formats the data not as \<String> but as &[u8] and that needs to be printed using a different print statement, but shows the underlying numeric representation of the data. Quite different from R - or?


Sequences can also be compacted using two bit per nucleotide and then a single u64 can contain the same info as a 32bp String.
With being an integer this representation of a DNA sequence opens up possibilities that you do simply not have in R.

```{extendr, eval=eval_rextender}
pub type Base = u8;
pub const A: Base = 0;
pub const C: Base = 1;
pub const G: Base = 2;
pub const T: Base = 3;

pub fn encode_binary(c: char) -> Base {
    // might have to play some tricks for lookup in a const
    // array at some point
    match c {
        'A' | 'a' => A,
        'C' | 'c' => C,
        'G' | 'g' => G,
        'T' | 't' => T,
        _ => panic!("cannot decode {c} into 2 bit encoding"),
    }
}

let s = String::from("AGCTAGCT");
let t = s.as_bytes();
let st = std::str::from_utf8(t).unwrap();
let mut w = 0_u8;
for c in st.chars().rev() {
    w <<= 2;
    w |= encode_binary(c);
}

rprintln!("{w:b}");
rprintln!("{w}");

```
# Create a new Rust program 

Rust is a compiled language and therefore interacting with it using a jupyter notebook or Rmd file does limit the language a lot.
Hence it makes more sense to compile Rust programs and use them on the command line. 

As an example of why - I deliberately broke the integer example:

```
let x:u8 = 5;
let y:u16 = 7;
let z = x*y;

rprintln!("{x} * {y} = {z}");
```

This breaks in RStudio. I can not generate the html file here using this code, but if I create a stand alone 'program' of it it works:


```{r , include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
unlink( 'workshop', recursive=TRUE )
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cargo new workshop --bin
```

Open the created file "workshop/srv/main.rs" and replace the "println!("Hello, world!");" with the broken code we had before.

```{bash,  error=TRUE}
cd workshop
cargo build -r
```

Here you see the output from the Rust compiler. Do you see the beauty of this?
The compiler explains the error and later on even points us to a possible solution:
We could cast the u16 to u8 in the formular.

```{extendr, eval=eval_rextender}
let x:u8 = 5;
let y:u16 = 7;
let z = x * y as u8;

rprintln!("{x} * {y} = {z}");
```

But the more resonable fix here would of cause be to not define the y as u16 in the first place - right?

# More complicated error hunting:

Now we need to dig deeper and I recommend you to use your programming IDE of choice to look into a new broken program. Rstudio would also do.

Lets look in the simple_problem folder in [this github repo](https://github.com/stela2502/Rust_Programming_1).

Download (clone) the repo using git ``git clone https://github.com/stela2502/Rust_Programming_1``. Open the folder 'simple_error' in your IDE and open a terminal and cd into this folder.

There you run:
```{bash,  error=TRUE}
cd simple_error
cargo build -r
```

It is almost no fun hiding programming erros as the compiler will already tell you what to do - right?
I think this nevertheless will be fun...

## Problem 1

Each line needs to end with a ';'. All but the last line in a function if you want to return a value.

## Promblem 2

We do not have a 'data' variable in the sum function. Here the data is called 'v' - fix that.

Now the code compiles:
```{bash,  error=TRUE}
cd simple_fixed
cargo build -r
target/release/simple_error
```

Does the output make sense?

## Problem 3

No it is wrong: We need to switch the variables in the println! function.

## Problem 4

Wait - we tried to sum up the values 6, 7, 8 and 9 - that is not 10?!
How do you fix that?

This one is rather complicated and I recommend you to add a test case before you try to fix it.


# Tests in Rust

Problem 4 is a good example for a really anoying bug. To get them and also make sure you will not re-introduce this bug later it makes a lot of sense to write a test that detects the error you have in your code before you try to fix it:


Rust has a nice way to do so:
Add this to the script

```
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::sum;
    #[test]
    fn check_sum() {
      
      let data:Vec<usize> = vec![1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];
      let ids:Vec<usize> = vec![5,6,7,8];
      
    	assert_eq!( sum( &data, &ids ), 30 );
    }
}
```

And now you can test your script by 

```{bash,  error=TRUE}
cd simple_fixed
cargo test -r
```

I hope you can find and fix the bug.
