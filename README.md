# Rust_Programming_1

This is a short Rust course for advanced bioinformaticians. 

In order to apply you are expected to know what object oriented programming is, know what ponters are and if possible have programmed a package in either R, Python, C++ or any other programing language before.

The course can be found here: https://stela2502.github.io/Rust_Programming_1/

It is very tailored to bioinformaticians.


# how to 'build' the documentation:

The easiest way is to install RStudio, clone this repo and open the RData here.

For all here included Rust packages as well as the html file itself you need Rust installed on your system.
The Rust code run by RStudio does not work on Windows.
