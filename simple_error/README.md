# A buggy function

This program has at least four bugs. I hope it is a good way to start to play with Rust.

# Usage

Clone the main repo, cd into this simple\_error folder and run

```
cargo build -r
```

Try to fix the errors and rinse repeat.

If you only find three bugs look into the results of the program. It does not calculate the correct values!
